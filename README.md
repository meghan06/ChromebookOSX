--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. Installation

Here are the steps to go from chromeOS to macOS via OpenCore on your Chromebook. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> **Warning** Pay _close_ attention to the Chromebook specific parts in the Dortania guide, specifically in `ACPI -> Booter` and the extra iGPU `boot-args`.

> **Warning** Pay _very_ close attention to the following steps, if you miss **even one**, your Chromebook will lose some functionally and might not even boot.

> **Note**: Those who are installing to an external disk like a USB drive can skip steps 8 and 9.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **These steps are **required** for proper functioning.**

1. If you haven't already, flash your Chromebook with [MrChromebox's UEFI firmware](https://mrchromebox.tech) via his scripts. To complete this process, you must turn off write protection either by using a SuzyQable cable or temporarily removing the battery (latter is less cumbersome).
2. Setup your EFI folder using the [OpenCore Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/). Use [Laptop Kaby Lake & Amber Lake Y](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/config-laptop.plist/kaby-lake.html#starting-point) for your `config.plist`. 
3. Re-visit this guide when you're done setting up your EFI. There are a few things we need to tweak to ensure our Chromebook works with macOS. Skipping these steps will result in a **very** broken hack.
4. **In your `config.plist`, under `Booter -> Quirks` set `ProtectMemoryRegions` to `TRUE` You MUST change this. It is FALSE by DEFAULT.** It should look something like this in your `config.plist` when done correctly:

   | Quirk                | Type | Value    |
   | -------------------- | ---- | -------- |
   | ProtectMemoryRegions | Boolean | True  |

4. Under `DeviceProperties -> Add -> PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x2,0x0)`, make the following modifications:
  
   | Key                  | Type | Value    |
   | -------------------- | ---- | -------- |
   | AAPL,ig-platform-id  | data | 0000C087 |
   | device-id            | data | C0870000 |
     
   > **Warning** **These should be the only two items `in PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x2,0x0)`.**
5. If you haven't already, add `igfxrpsc=1` and `-igfxnotelemetryload` to your `boot-args`, under `NVRAM -> Add -> 7C436110-AB2A-4BBB-A880-FE41995C9F82,`. Both are for iGPU support, **you will regret it if you don't add these.**
6. **Set your SMBIOS as MacBookAir8,1**. Ignore what the guide tells you to use, MacBookAir8,1 works better with our laptop.
     > **Note** If you choose to use `MacBook10,1`, which also works, you will not have Low Battery Mode.
7. Download [EmeraldSDHC](https://github.com/acidanthera/EmeraldSDHC/releases) for eMMC storage support. Put it in your Kexts folder. 
8. Download corpnewt's SSDTTime, then launch it and select `FixHPET` as the first option. Next, select `'C'` for the default setting, and drag the SSDT it generated (`SSDT-HPET.aml`) into your `ACPI` folder. Finally, copy the patches from `oc_patches.plist` into your `config.plist` under `ACPI -> Patch`. This is to ensure eMMC storage is recognized my macOS.
9. Map your USB ports³ before installing ~~to prevent dead hard drives, thermonuclear war, or you getting fired.~~ See [Misc. Information](#misc-information) for a note to USBToolBox users.    
10. Using corpnewt's SSDTTime, dump your DSDT, generate `SSDT-USB-RESET.aml`, drag it to your ACPI folder, and reload your `config.plist`. **Required** for working USB ports.
11. Snapshot (cmd +r) or (ctrl + r) your `config.plist`. 
12. Install macOS and enjoy!

> **Note**: More information about specific quirks can be found [here.](https://dortania.github.io/docs/latest/Configuration.html)

- Please read [Security.md](SECURITY.md) as it provides in-depth information on sanitizing your serials, disk encryption, and more.
- **If you discover a vulnerability, please refer to [Security.md](SECURITY.md).** 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Keyboard Remapping

1. Download the custom remap SSDT
2. 




--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### neofetch
for those that want to install neofetch but don't want to download Xcode / homebrew.


1. Download the latest release of [neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch/releases/tag/7.1.0) and extract it's contents.
2. Delete everything except for `neofetch`.
3. Copy that file to `Users/yourname/`, with `yourname` being your account name.
4. Open Terminal.
5. Type `nano ~/.zshrc`
6. Then, paste/type `alias neofetch=./neofetch` in nano. 
7. Close `nano`, via `CTRL+X`. Make sure to select `Y` and save it.
8. Restart terminal.
9. Test the changes you just made by typing `neofetch` in your terminal and pressing enter.


#### A few things to keep in mind:
- This only works when you're cd'd into your home directory (`User/name`). 
- If you want to fix this, it's simple; replace `alias neofetch=./neofetch` with `alias neofetch=cd Users/yourname; ./neofetch`, replacing `yourname` with the name of your user.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Continuity Features

- the wireless chip is soldered on, you can't replace it. :(

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Audio

**For anybody looking to get audio working, here are a some bits of info you can use:**

- Intel DSP discussion:
  - https://github.com/acidanthera/bugtracker/issues/2084
- If you are willing to contribute, make a template driver that has 2 inputs + output endpoints that gets a DMA buffer + position callback from macOS
- C425 is not HD audio, it uses an Intel DSP (branded as Smart Sound) and is i2s from that coprocessor
- google src code for max98927 (for chromeOS)
  - [google src code for max98927](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/depthcharge/+/refs/heads/master/src/drivers/sound/max98927.c)
- Soundflower, a simple template that can be used for the driver
  - [github.com/RogueAmoeba/Soundflower-Original](https://github.com/RogueAmoeba/Soundflower-Original)
  - More info here: [cdn.discordapp.com](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1051619981642706947/1077064200490324019/image.png)
- Base HD Audio driver for Skylake and up. Used for HDMI Audio support on Windows.
  - [github.com/coolstar/sklhdaudbus](https://github.com/coolstar/sklhdaudbus)
- DMIC uses DA7219 as the mic array, max98927 as the audio codec.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Misc. Information

- When formatting the eMMC drive in Disk Utility, make sure to toggle "Show all Drives" and **erase the WHOLE drive**, not just the current partition.
- Format the drive as `APFS`
- Map your USB ports prior to installing macOS³ for a painless install. You **will** reget it if you don't. You can use [USBToolBox](https://github.com/USBToolBox/tool) to do that. If you are using USBToolBox (Mainly Windows users), you need a second kext that goes along with it. [Github repo here](https://github.com/USBToolBox/kext). USBToolBox will not work without this kext. 
- `itlwm` is more stable & faster than `AirportItlwm`
- You might have DRM issues, there's no fix for this. :(
- Control keyboard backlight with left `ctrl` + left `alt` and `<` `>`. 
    - `<` to decrease, `>` to increase.
- To fix the battery life on Ventura, you can set Low Battery Mode to be always enabled on battery. It's not perfect, but it helps. You can also use CPUFriend to tweak power settings but you may or may not cause your hack to die on boot.
- eMMC will come up as an external drive in the boot picker since eMMC is just an embedded SD card. Nothing you can do about it.
- To hide the drive picker, set `ShowPicker` to `False` in `Misc` ->` Boot` -> `ShowPicker`
- `AppleXcpmCfgLock` and `DisableIOMapper` can be enabled or disabled. Makes no difference.
- It's worth noting that while it's recommended, coreboot already includes mapped USB ports, meaning that USB mapping is not required. Proceed at your  own risk if you decide to skip USB mapping.
- Make sure your `ScanPolicy` is set to `0`. eMMC will not be recognized if it's some other value.
- Please report any broken links in issues. Half this guide was written while I was high. /s
- **USB ports will ONLY work with SSDT-USB-Reset / SSDT-RHUB.** 
  - Note: This is not needed if using USBToolBox

#### *Note: The hotkey to show drives **DOES NOT WORK**. Make a copy of your EFI with `ShowPicker` enabled if you need to boot from another drive.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. macOS Ventura
> **Note** Only for those who want macOS Ventura. 

Before we get started, you should know the following:
- **Your battery will drain faster on Ventura.** To avoid this, stay on Monterey or older.


With that, lets get started!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### For those updating:
> **Note**: these steps can be done after updating, you just won't have WiFi. It is recommended to follow the steps below **before** updating for the least amount of pain and suffering.

1. Mount your EFI using corpnewt's MountEFI.
2. Under OC/Kexts, delete your old itlwm/AirportItlwm kext and replace it with `itlwm v.2.2.0 alpha`
3. Download and install Heliport if you haven't already. The most recent stable release will work fine.
4. Launch ProperTree and reload (`ctrl+r`) your `config.plist`. 
5. Start the update. (If you haven't already)
6. You are now ready for macOS Ventura! 
7. [See below](#fixing-wifi-on-ventura) for fixing WiFi.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Preparations for installing Ventura directly:

> **Note**: For Windows and Linux users only.

1. Under OC/Kexts, delete your old itlwm/AirportItlwm kext and replace it with `itlwm v.2.2.0 alpha`
2. Open up your kext folder, and locate `itlwm.kext`. 
3. Open it, and find `Info.plist`.
4. Open ProperTree, navigate to where your `Info.plist` is, and open it.
5. Under `IOKitPersonalities -> itlwm -> WiFiConfig`, enter your WiFI details. Save and close when done.
7. Launch ProperTree and reload (`ctrl+r`) your `config.plist`. 
8. Boot recovery. There will be no WiFi logo/symbol, but you will have WiFi. If you are able to install macOS, then you have not fucked up.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Fixing WiFi on Ventura 

> **Note** **Only for those that have macOS installed but haven't edited their `Info.plist`.**

1. Mount your EFI
2. Open up your kext folder, and locate `itlwm.kext`. 
3. Click it, and select `Show Package Contents` and open the Contents folder. Once inside, find the `Info.plist` and copy it via  `ctrl + c`.
4. Exit `itlwm.kext` and go back to your Kext folder. Paste your `Info.plist`.
5. Open ProperTree, select the `Info.plist` in your Kext folder and open it.
6. Under `IOKitPersonalities -> itlwm -> WiFiConfig`, enter your WiFI details. Save and close when done.
7. Replace the old `Info.plist` with the one you just edited. 


Do note that Heliport will report no WiFi upon logging in but keep in mind you actually do thanks to the edits we just made. :)

# Post Install

Nothing much is actually needed, you can just follow the [Dortania guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/) for it. Generally speaking, you'll want to:

1. Move your EFI onto your ESP
2. Remove Verbose
3. Switch from Debug OC to Release OC
4. Remove debugging in config.plist

# Welcome to ChromebookOSX!
This repository covers the installation of macOS on the ASUS C425, C434, and C433 using MrChromebox UEFI firmware and OpenCore bootloader.

### This guide will cover the following:
- Firmware and software patches for macOS
- A step by step guide on installing macOS for afformentioned models.
- A detailed post-install guide

### This guide will NOT cover the following:
- Ways to illegally obtain macOS
- A prebuilt EFI

Note that these things often take weeks to complete, and take paitence and some basic knowledge on how PCs function. Because of this, you are expected to use Google. This is NOT a one-click thing.
